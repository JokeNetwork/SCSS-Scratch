# SCSS Scratch
SCSS Scratch combines the idea of [barebones](https://github.com/nothingrandom/barebones) with SCSS and folders, which can be used for the structure of further projects.

### Instructions
**Note:** This is **not** recommended for production use, as the folder-structure is adjusted to my projects.
